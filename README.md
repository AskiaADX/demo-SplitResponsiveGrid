Possible variables to be open to the end-users
----------------------------------------------

-	`<thead>` and `<th>` / color and background-color.

-	`border-size` and `border-color` for`<table>`and`<tr>`
-	`background-color` of `<tr>` when `:hover`

This demo was successfully tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE9+. Media queries are **not supported in IE 8 and lower** so these will not render the split version the question table.
